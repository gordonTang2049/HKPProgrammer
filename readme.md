# Introduction

    Hi, How are you guys?  This is a github repo for people chil out and practice coding, 
    
    no matter you are newbie or guru, everyone is welcome to contribute and share.

    Of course, if you have some project idea or interesting coding challenge, 
    
    you can also let us know and push to the repo.

    Since python seems popular among us, I will finish my code in Python, 
    
    even though I am a super newbie on it, you can choose whatever language to 

    get the job done

    I will also host a slack group, I ll share the link soon, you guys add to it.

    There are few points to help you learn a new language quick, 
            1. Understand language data type
                    - primative
                        Int
                        Float
                        STR
                        
                    - non-primative 
                        SET
                        TUPLE
                        DICT 
                
    In this first few weeks, we will practice the basis of python:
            - data type
            - built-in functions

    It is important to understand data type on new language because it has different attributes that help you solve the problem. 
    Manipulating data is also a crucial skill in programming. Using bulit in function to solve your problem and boost your productivty.


# coding challenge 1 - Palindrome Number

    This challenge comes from leetcode, 

    Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

    Example 1:

    Input: 121
    Output: true
    Example 2:

    Input: -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    Example 3:

    Input: 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    Follow up:

    Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

# coding challenge 2 - length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

            Example 1:

            Input: "abcabcbb"
            Output: 3 
            Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
            Example 2:

            Input: "bbbbb"
            Output: 1
            Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
            Example 3:

            Input: "pwwkew"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
            Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
